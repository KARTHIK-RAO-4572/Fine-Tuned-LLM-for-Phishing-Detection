## Background
Phishing refers to the act of obtaining confidential information, with messages that seem legitimate, but not. It is the most popular and frequent attack among all the cyber attacks. Depending on the media format of message, there are varities of phishing such as Classic (Text-Email), Vishing (Voice-Call), Smishing (Text-SMS), etcetera. 

With the advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), attackers are now using LLMs to generate human-like, targetted and high quality messages to craft phishing messages. With the high quality and absence of "phishing indicators", existing defense systems are often failing to flag phishing messages

## What did we do?
The basic, yet important thing in all the variatons of phishing is the message.
